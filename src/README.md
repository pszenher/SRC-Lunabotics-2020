# NASA Robotic Mining Competition: Lunabotics

The repository is organized into different ROS packages. The repository should be
in your catkin_ws/src directory to work properly and to stay with the structure.

Please keep everything organized as ROS packages so you don't break other people's
catkin workspaces. Make branches and stuff obviously we'll talk about this later.

If any packages have a models folder you'll need to copy that into your /.gazebo/models directory in order for a world to spawn it.

Please try to include a README with any packages you make with their purpose and
the necessary packages to run them.
